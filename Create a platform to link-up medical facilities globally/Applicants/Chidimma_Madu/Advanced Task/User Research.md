# UX Research on an App that Link-Up Medical Facilities Globally 

## Research Summarry
To create an effective UI/UX for this app, I first conducted secondary research on the needs of medical professionals, hospitals and the existing apps and platforms they use to better understand their workflow and the challenges they face when collaborating with other medical professionals or hospitals.

**Key Findings:** Through my research, I found that medical professionals/hospitals value ease of use and speed when it comes to communicating and sharing information. They also value a secure platform that ensures the privacy of patient information. Other key findings include the need for features such as real-time chat, file sharing, and Referral management
