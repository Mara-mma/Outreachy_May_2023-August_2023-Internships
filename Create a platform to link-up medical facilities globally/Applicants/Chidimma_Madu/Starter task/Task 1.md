# Hospital Data Collection Tool

## Overview
I use Google Forms as the format for the data collection tool. This tool is designed to collect information about hospitals, including their name, location, services, and facilities available. The tool can be used remotely or on-site, and it is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the hospital to aid in decision-making.

**Fields to include:**

* Hospital Name

* Hospital Address (including city, state/province, and zip/postal code)

* Contact Information (phone number, email, website)

* Type of Hospital (e.g. public, private, non-profit)

* Services Offered (e.g. emergency care, surgery, outpatient services)

* Facilities Available (e.g. ICU, MRI, laboratory)

* Insurance Accepted (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance)

* Staff Information (number of doctors, nurses, and support staff)

* Accreditation and Certifications (e.g. Joint Commission, ISO)

* Patient Feedback and Reviews

* Additional Notes/Comments
